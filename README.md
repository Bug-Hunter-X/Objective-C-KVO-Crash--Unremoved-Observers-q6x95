# Objective-C KVO Crash: Unremoved Observers

This repository demonstrates a common, yet insidious, bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C.  Failing to remove KVO observers properly can lead to crashes when the observed object is deallocated.  The provided code showcases the bug and its solution.

## Bug Description
The bug stems from neglecting to remove KVO observers in the `-dealloc` method or when the observed object's lifecycle ends. When the observed object is deallocated, the KVO observer attempts to access it, resulting in a crash.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all KVO observers are removed before the observed object is deallocated. This is crucial for preventing crashes and ensuring application stability.  The solution code demonstrates best practices for handling KVO observers.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and run the `KVO_Crash.m` file.  Observe the crash.
3. Compile and run the `KVO_Crash_Solution.m` file.  Note that there is no crash.
