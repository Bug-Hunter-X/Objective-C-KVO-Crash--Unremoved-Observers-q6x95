This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  If you don't remove observers in `-dealloc` or when the observed object is deallocated, you'll get crashes when the observed object deallocates. This is because the observer is still trying to access the deallocated object.  This is especially insidious because it might not always cause an immediate crash, leading to hard-to-debug intermittent problems.
